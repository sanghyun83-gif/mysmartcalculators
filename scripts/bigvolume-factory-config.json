Originally developed in the 19th century as the Quetelet Index, it was never intended as an individual health diagnostic. However, contemporary medicine uses it as a critical correlate for metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular risk mortality. In 2026, clinical consensus emphasizes using BMI as the 'first-pass' audit, focusing on clinical obesity vs. preclinical obesity categories established by the WHO."

Conversely, 'Skinny Fat' individuals may present a 'Normal' BMI while carrying dangerous levels of visceral adipose tissue around the organs. Clinical precision in 2026 requires looking at waist circumference and age-adjusted metabolic panels alongside the core BMI number."
