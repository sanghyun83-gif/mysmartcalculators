    faqs: [
        { "question": "What makes a calculator 'scientific'?", "answer": "A scientific calculator performs functions beyond basic arithmetic, including trigonometry (sin/cos/tan), logarithms, exponentials, and root functions for complex problem solving." },
        { "question": "How do shift/second functions work?", "answer": "Most keys have a secondary function printed above them. Pressing the 'SHIFT' or '2ND' key activates these alternative operations, such as inverse sine or square root." },
        { "question": "What is the difference between DEG and RAD modes?", "answer": "DEG (Degrees) is used for standard geometry, while RAD (Radians) is used in calculus and physics. Radians express angles through the radius of a circle (2π = 360°)." },
        { "question": "Can I use this scientific calculator for the SAT?", "answer": "Yes. While specific models vary, the core functions provided (trig, log, powers) are fully compliant with 2026 College Board and ACT digital testing guidelines." },
        { "question": "How do I calculate 10 to the power of x?", "answer": "Use the '^' or 'y^x' key. For base-10 specifically, many calculators have a '10^x' button often accessed via the 2ND/SHIFT function of the 'log' key." },
        { "question": "What is the value of 'e' on a calculator?", "answer": "The constant 'e' (Euler's number) is approximately 2.71828. It is the base of natural logarithms and is vital for calculating continuous compounding and growth." },
        { "question": "Does this calculator handle fractions?", "answer": "Yes. Modern scientific calculators allow fraction input (a/b) and provide one-touch conversion between fractional and decimal formats (S<->D key)." },
        { "question": "What are parentheses used for in math?", "answer": "Parentheses enforce the order of operations. They ensure that the calculator processes grouped terms together before applying other functions like multiplication or powers." },
        { "question": "How accurate is the floating-point calculation?", "answer": "Standard scientific calculators use 10 to 12 digits of internal precision, preventing round-off errors in multi-step engineering problems." },
        { "question": "What is 'Syntax Error' and how do I fix it?", "answer": "This occurs when the mathematical sequence is invalid (e.g., unmatched parentheses or dividing by zero). Check your input layout and clear the entry." },
        { "question": "How do I calculate the square root vs nth root?", "answer": "The '√' key handles square roots. For higher roots (cube root or higher), use the 'x√y' function, usually found above the power key." },
        { "question": "What is scientific notation (EXP)?", "answer": "Calculators use the 'EXP' or 'EE' key to handle very large or small numbers (e.g., 6.02 x 10^23) by representing the base and exponent separately." },
        { "question": "Can it solve quadratic equations?", "answer": "Many high-end scientific calculators have a built-in 'SOLVE' or 'EQN' mode that can find roots for quadratic and cubic equations automatically." },
        { "question": "Does it have a memory feature?", "answer": "Yes. Use 'STO' to store a result into a variable (like X or Y) and 'RCL' to bring it back. The 'ANS' key always holds the result of your last operation." },
        { "question": "How do I reset my calculator?", "answer": "Access the 'RESET' or 'CLEAR' menu (often SHIFT + 9) to wipe stored variables and return all modes (DEG/RAD) to their factory defaults." }
